Vim-like Text Objects for Gedit
===============================

**Experimental** support for Vim text objects for Gedit. The plugin defines two
keyboard shortcuts:

- `Ctrl+Shift+D`     --- delete
- `Ctrl+Shift+Space` --- select

After pressing a shortcut, text object should be specified (list of supported
objects and modifiers is displayed in pop-up).

**Installation:**
Copy file `text_objects.plugin` and directory `text_objects` to
`~/.local/share/gedit/plugins` directory and enable plugin in Gedit preferences.
